PREFACE.

'l'rrrr present volume of letters differs from ita predecessor
in one or two respecta. It was found, when the period
of the barona' wars came to be examined in detail, that
to carry out in full the plan of the first volume was
impractioable. To have printed from the Close and
Patent Rolls every unpublished letter of interest which
hore on the events referred to in the Royal Letters would
have extended the work altogether beyond the limita
contemplated. Moreover, it would not have been, when
done, a really complete work, for many entries on the
Rom, which are not properly letters, are not lese im-
portant, nor less deserving of publication This is eape-
cially true of the Patent Roll of 49 Hen. ΙΙΙ. Το have
made any adequate extracta from thia roll alone would
have occupied more than fifty pages3 and after all, tha
extracta would only have left the feeling that the roll
should be printed in full. It hae, therefore, boen left
untouched, and, generally, throughout the period of the
actual war of the barons the extracta have been made
with a very scanty hand, compared with the materiale
available They must evidently be dealt with at some
timeon a reale altogether larger than the plan of thio

work allows. The collection of bons which appeared in
the Appendix to the first volume hasbeen discontinued.
It has been considered irrelevant and unintereoting, and
has therefore been withdrawn to give room for a larger
selection of lettere.
