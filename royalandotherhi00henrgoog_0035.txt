PRRFAOR xxv

St. Richord of Chichcster, and tbe incessant efforts of
proctor aiter proctor ιο obtain a full and unconditional
absolutiones the king from the engagements he had
made to hia barons.

Scarcely less rare, at so early a dote, though wholly
different in kind, are the letters written to the cbancellor,
Ralph Neville, biahop of Chichester, by tho steward of
bis private estates, and which have streyed by some
fortunate accident into the bundles ol public letters pre·
served by the chaucellor's official care. The marling ot*
the bishop's land, and the erectior of his windmill, then
aoomparatively new inventi0n; the impossibility οι
selling his old wine, because new wine was so abundant
at Chichester; the purchase of eloth for distribution to
the p00r; the sending donkeys from London ιο Sussex
to carry a supply of fish3 the advice that the chancellor
should send aa invitation ιο the archbishop of Canter-
bury—no particular friend-which it would be creditable

to give, and which it is known he will not eccept; the
write to reclaim the chancellor's runaway serfs3 the
repertos the audacious chaplain, who keeps two wives,
and claime a papal dispensation3 the shuffling abbot ol
Saea, who cannot be kept to his bargain—all these are

details which bring borne with vividncss the domestic
lile ol the period.

Το the editor himself, what has scemed the most dis·
tinctive interest οι the letters arises from the insight which ·
they give into the practical working of the governmont.
What justioes, and ahcriffs, end seneschals, and proctors
really did ; where the ebrrses of the government really
lay; how far the poweri'ul and the rich could or could
not dely or evade the law; how much was dependent
on the personal character of the sove1·eigu; bowser or
how osten the career of a statesmen was really open to a
subject ; what were the every-day relations between the
Church and State-these are things which can be really
learnt from the letters now before us ; they cen be known
