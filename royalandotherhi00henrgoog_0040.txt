Our truce with France was broken because the
king would not grant redress sor the infractione
of it. We therefore began to make war against .
him. and marehed from Pons to Saintes, and so ·
to Tonnuy. Thence to Taillebourg‚ where the
bridge was betrayed to the French king, and we
were compelled to retreat to Saintes, where the
French attempted to surprise us, but were com·
pelled, aller a sharp action, to retreat Two days
asterwards we withdrew to Pons, aud thence to
Barbeaieux, where li. de Ponte and the count
of La biarche deserted us, aiter attempting to
lead us into the hands of the French king, which
we only escaped bya forced march to Blaye.
We have since retreated into Gascony. We
should hare good friends in Burgundy it the
county were not in the duke’s hands.
