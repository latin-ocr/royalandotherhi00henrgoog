romeon xiii

For the next three months we hear of 'nothing but of
agents busy at the court of Rome to procure for the
king a release from all hie obligations more absolute
than any yet granted. In this field the success of the
king was complete. At an earlier date we read of proe-
tors and counter-prootors, both armed with a seemingly
equal authority, but uttering language the most oppo-
site; we hear of many enemies in the papal court,
and the prejudioea of the pope himself ; but now, after
great difficulties, the roynl prootor report's that he has
obtained a bull revoking in the most absolute manner
every aet and· deed of the baronial oouneil of twenty-four.

On the 2nd of May 1262 the papal absolution was
proolaimed by the royal letters patent¹ On the llth
of May we hear of a fresh arbitration between the earl
of Glouoester and the king.2 This time the name of
Montfort is significantly absent Ho had withdrawn
disbeartened to the continent, declaring that whatever

it might be to others, the ooth of Oxford was binding
still to him.

In the month oi July, Gloucester died ; and with him
well nigh expired the hopeless series of arbitratione
which complicata so strangely the history of the pre-
ceding fifteen months. Montlort, who, by his death,
suooeeded to the soleleadeiship of the party, was not
disposed to ronew them, unless he could have some

reasonable hope of their leading to a lasting peace.
